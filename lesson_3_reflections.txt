When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I need my work on different computer, I would create remote reposiroty rather than local. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Automatically pull changes might cause confliction between local and remote repository.
